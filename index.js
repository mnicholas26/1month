What a month it's been!

Emily I've told you that I don't really remember my dreams. I wake up and bosh; whatever was in my head evaporates.
But that doesn't mean I don't dream.
I do this thing I call half dream. It's like a daydream but more vivid and tactile.
When I wake up, just before I fully awaken and when I'm not too tired that I just go back to sleep, when I know I don't need to get out of bed.
I can turn on my side, close my eyes and drift off into whatever world I want.
These aren't full dreams, I'm very much concious, but they can feel very strong and unlike full dreams I have a good amount of autonomy on what I'm dreaming about.
Doing this I feel like I have lived my life 10000x over.
I've seen so many alternate versions of me in all sorts of paths through life.
A footballer, a politician, a billionaire.
Every nice future I wanted to ponder I already have multiple times.
But any time I wanted to feel really happy I always ended up in the same place.
Telling you I love you and living happily ever after.

In reality I've told you my feelings 3 times, and even then the first time wasn't with my full chest.
But in my half dreams I have told you thousands of times.
In Waverly, in Bellevue, in Balloon Court, in Germany, in Malaga, in London, in your parents house. Wherever I thought our next encounter would/might be.
Usually I wouldn't get much further than that, even with my frothing imagination, I had no real comprehension of what would follow, of what happily ever after would entail.
I just knew how happy it made me.
For the longest time I was resigned to this just being a happy place I would go into and would stay firmly in my head.

This past month has blown every single one of those dreams out of the water.
The happiness I get to feel every single day far exceeds even what, with almost full control of my dreams, I had ever anticipated.

I cannot express, no matter how good I am with my words and feelings, no matter how much time I have, just how much you mean to me.
How happy I am, how much I love you, how determined you make me, how amazing you are.
Now, I'm still gonna try, at every opportunity I get, to tell you and to show you just how much I appreciate you.
But until the day comes where I can take my brain and my memories and my feelings and inject them into yours, I will probably not be able to ever communicate it completely.

@This has been the best month of my life.
@This is the best I have ever felt.
@You are the best person I have ever met.

I don't care that the calendar says August now.
I won't care when the season turns to autumn, and then winter.
I won't care when the year ticks over to 2026 or 2030 or 2100.

I have no intention of this month ever ending.

@From here on out, I'm staying in our magical July forever.
@@Happily~ ever~ after.~~~`;
